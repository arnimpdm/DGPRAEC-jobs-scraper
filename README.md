# DGPRAEC-jobs-scraper-and-notifier
A end-to-end solution which provides updates about new jobs from a website for surgents.

The focus of this repo lies on the end-to-end solution. Not really a Analytics/Data Science case but a good exercise to practice python skills.

Feel free to comment on this or to send me an email.
